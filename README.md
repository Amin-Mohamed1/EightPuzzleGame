The Eight-Puzzle Game is a classic sliding puzzle consisting of a 3x3 grid with eight numbered tiles and one empty space. The goal is to arrange the tiles in a specific order, typically from 1 to 8, with the empty space at the bottom right.
This project implements various Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms to solve the puzzle, including:

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- **Astar Search**
- **Iterative Deepening Search (IDS)**
